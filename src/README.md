##**Gridfolio**

**Gridfolio** is a portfolio generator for developers. More specifically, developers who want to spend time on cool projects, not their portfolio website.

----------


Quickstart
-------------

First, install packages from the root directory:

```$ npm install```


----------


Next, get the server up and running:

```$ npm start```

----------

Nice! You should now be able to access Gridfolio at this URL:

```https://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server```

----------

Customization (basic)
-------------

Coming soon.
